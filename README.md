Here are step-by-step instructions for how to make a basic version of the template that LFC Eukaryon will be printed with in 2019. This includes setting up your workspace in Indesign, working with Master Pages, and Formatting Text. I hope to add soon some information about how to insert and embed images by the end of 2018.
